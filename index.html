        <h4 class="para-subtitle">Deep into selectors</h4>
        <p class="blog-para">When things get more complicated and you have to arrange more and more elements
    you need to have more specific selectors. You can give two or more class to a single element by adding a space, you can also style only
    one kind of elements with the same class by adding the html tag before the .class-name in CSS.

    <h4 class="para-subtitle">More layout properties</h4>
    <p class="blog-para">Today I got to know the float and clear properties.
        They allow me to move things around without them wrapping around elements or overlapping. 
        Moreover, I designed the layout of my
    blog on paper for the first time.</p>

<div class="para" id="twelve">
    <h2 class="para-date">12 03</h2>
    <h4 class="para-subtitle">CSS layout</h4>
    <p class="blog-para">I started using div and span tags to group either parts of text or block of elements; 
        then I modified width and height of my div blocks and set the overflow value(visible, hidden or auto). 
        Afterwards, I started applying margins(top bottom left or right), borders(px style and colours) and paddings to blocks and images.
    Then I started using position attribute. While struggling with relative and absolute position,
     I immediately understood the use and the potential of fixed position.The google maps video was useful to understand 
     the functioning of z index.</p>

    <h4 class="para-subtitle">Let's get CSSing</h4>
    <p class="blog-para">Today I dived into CSS, particulary focusing on text formatting and style using tags such as
         "font-family" or "line-height". 
        I can now make a text look bolder, or change it's color and background, underline it, remove the underline from links, 
        change the font or align it</p>

<div class="para" id="ten">
    <h2 class="para-date">10 03</h2>
    <h4 class="para-subtitle">My first dive into HTML!</h4>
    <p class="blog-para">I started watching videos and learnt smth about how HTML works.
        For example, I started getting accostumed with the syntax, inserting images and links(both internal and external) 
        and I started using Visual Studio code.Furthermore, I began to use CSS selectors to change the style of my webpage,
         no longer reliying on inline attributes.</p>
